# MTGCardReader

Reads a Magic: The Gathering card in front of a webcam and identifies it in an existing database of cards of a user-specified set.

Run __MTGCardReader.py__ to start the program.

Run __install_packages.py__ to install the requisite packages _(NOTE: This is currently untested)_

When loading up a set for the first time, the program may take 5 minutes or more to download and store all images from that set.
